# Demos And Intros

Welcome my collection of demos and intros, developed between 1995-1997 as practice in computer graphics programming.

Back in those days, I've started to grew an interest for low level graphics programming. In 1995, university got internet and in that year, I've spent nights there scouring FTPs for graphic programming tutorials. While I eventually got to be good at it, demos also required music and I was absolutely dreadful at audio programming. Initial attempts at writing a mod player following docs didn't go very well and had to find ready-made mod players. This is why music integration/syncronization with the effects is virtually non-existent.

You'll find below a detailed list of them and a brief story for each of them, as much as I can remember.

## Amorphis
It's a 64k demo made in 1996, the best I managed to make given my total lack of art direction (or art...anything)

It features a mix of 2D and 3D effects, all pretty standard and maybe a bit dated for that time. I'm proud of the credits effect, a pixel tornado, which I think it was original for that time.

This one comes with a credit to my late graphics programming teacher at university, Mr Sorin Babii (PhD). Rest in pixels.

## Iced
It's a 16k demo made in 1996, featuring a mix of 2D and 3D. The highlight is almost real-time ray tracing, basically it pre-renders a couple of animation frames, hence "almost". Still pretty cool for 16k.

The rest is a pixel effect - I was big fan of those - probably from my ZX Spectrum days and a standard fractal + fancy 3D scrolling.

## Compile
My first demo, showing off a combination of 2D and 3D effects, all pretty standard. Developed in February-March 1996 on a 386-DX40 (heh)

Badly lacks art and direction.

## Mercury Wind
A tiny intro for Traian Pop's birthday, features an animated fractal-ish tree. Coded in an afternoon.

## Infelif
Small intro made as a gift for my father to use as a screen-saver at his new workplace, Infelif. Made in 1996.

## Scroll Balls and Snow
Intro/gifts for my father when he got hired at Petroconst in 1997. Snow features a pixel snow effect, Scroll Balls a 3D scrolling effect, also used in Compile.

## Torent
Intro for a BBS that was running in Constanta in 1997. Not sure if the sysop ended up using it. Or if the BBS even took off.

## XTest
A tester for various extended VESA graphics modes, featuring a bump map with real-time illumination and a 2D pallete effect. Made as a showcase for a lab at university.

## Little
A full assembler (TASM dialect) intro, featuring.......lots...of...points........in...3D..........

## Harmony
An unfinished demo, developed together with a colleague, Marcel Hanches. Don't have a build for it, but the idea was around projecting and animating multi-dimensional surfaces. Not even sure what this was supposed to mean, but we had some good times brain-storming about it.

## Setup&Install&Build (original)

They may only be built using Turbo/Borland Pascal. The full assembler ones require Turbo Assembler (TASM), part of the Borland tool suite.
