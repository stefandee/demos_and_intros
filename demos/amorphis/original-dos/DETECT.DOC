  DETECT.TPU

  Soundblaster autodetect routine.
  Based on TINY MOD v0.1b by Carlos Hasan, (C) 1993.
  Supplemented and recoded for PASCAL by TSC-Software, 1995.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  When you link this unit into your program, it will automaticly detect the
  Soundblaster's base address, interrupt channel and DSP version as soon as
  your program is being executed.

  It defines the following interface data:


  Const                              { CardType values }
   NONE          = 0;
   SB            = 1;
   SBPRO         = 2;
   SB16          = 3;

  Type                               { nessecarry Soundblaster data }
   SbDataRec     = Record
    CardType:    Byte;               { type of SB card (s.a.)       }
    DSPNum:      Word;               { version of DSP               }
    SbAddr:      Word;               { base address                 }
    SbIrq:       Word;               { irq channel                  }
   End;

  Var
   SBData:       SBDataRec;


  The units MODULES.TPU and VOCS.TPU need these data in their initialisation
  routines. So make sure, that DETECT.TPU is available, if  you want to  use
  one of these libraries.
