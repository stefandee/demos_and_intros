	  The revised version.
	  I thought that the MOD player is smart enough not to start
	playing if there's no SoundBlaster. I had to correct this,and
	now I hope will work on every machine.

	  This demo requires a DX2-66 minimum (but not tested).The dream 
	configuration is P-90 with PCI card.It is _ADVISABLE_ that you
	should not run this demo from Win95 or Win3;because of the timer 
	interferences, as my demo requires for some effects an enormous
	60 FPS(frames per second), this speed can't be achieved in
	a multitasking environment like Win95 or its ancestor,Win3.
	I also _ADVISE_ that you don't run it under any DOS emulators
	for OS/2,UNIX or APPLE.It'll simply won't work !

	  Be sure that the DMA of your soundcard is 1, or you might not 
	hear music.I didn't test it on a computer without soundcard and 
	I think it might hang your computer just before exit.

	  This demo proves my skill in creating even this kind of demo-
	the 64k-and was written in about 3 weeks in august 1997.

	  You are free to use and spread this demo any way you like as
	long as you don't charge money for it . My only request is to 	
	distribute the executable along with file,"amorphis.nfo".

	  I tested it and worked fine and smooth on my computer but 
	I don't guarantee functionality on any particular hardware 
	and configuration. Also, don't blame me if my demo burns 
	your computer : USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK !

	  From now on, I am available for commercial demos.Send your
	request on e-mail pp709@cs.utt.ro or voice 041-623755 . You 
	should think about the type of the demo(executable/animation),
	some content guidelines, the size, the time length and other 
	things that might strike your mind.Of course,the price is 
	proportional to the amount of work :-)(I am smart,don't I ?)

	  In AUTUMN, I will bring you the Pascal & Asm source code 
	of this demo(please don't fire me for using Pascal rather 
	than C;I have _very_ strong reasons !).The package will also
	contain the technical detail over some effects in the demo,
	the math behind it(for the begginers) and some thoughts about
	modern art.It will be available in the FTP site linked to 
	WWW.UTT.RO. Check this out,it really worth downloading !

	  Hope to hear you soon !
